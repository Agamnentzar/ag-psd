    // error or use default
  }

- Added handling for layer effects (blending options) (supports all effects except "Pattern Overlay")
- Added `writePsdUint8Array` function for saving to `Uint8Array` (this avoids double memory allocation)

## v5.0.0
- Simplified canvas initialization on NodeJS

  before:

  import { createCanvas } from 'canvas';
  import { readPsd, initializeCanvas } from 'ag-psd';

  initializeCanvas(createCanvas);
  ```
  after:
  ```typescript
  import 'ag-psd/initialize-canvas';
  import { readPsd } from 'ag-psd';
  ```

  before:
  ```typescript
  // node
  import { readPsd } from 'ag-psd';

  // browser
  import { readPsd } from 'ag-psd/dist/browser';
  ```
  after:
  ```typescript
  // node or browser
  import { readPsd } from 'ag-psd';
  ```
